Flexbox
========
Flexbox is new layout model in CSS3. This is proposed for ensuring that the elements behave properly when page layout is rendered in to different screen size and layout.

With Flexbox you do not need the float to keep the elements in place.

Flexbox is not supported by all versions of browser as of now but most famous browsers already support that.

Flex Container and Flex Items
===============================
Flexbox contains the flex containers and inside container there are flex items. To declare the flex container we need to set the display property to "flex" or "inline-flex".
Inside the flexbox container there are flex items.

Here is the list of properties for flexbox container.

display: flex | inline-flex; 									
	Specifies the type of box used for an HTML element
	
flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse; 	
	Specifies the direction of the flexible items inside a flex container
	
justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around;
	Horizontally aligns the flex items when the items do not use all available space on the main-axis

align-items:
	Vertically aligns the flex items when the items do not use all available space on the cross-axis
	
flex-wrap:
	Specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not, if there is not enough room for them on one flex line

align-content:
		Modifies the behavior of the flex-wrap property. It is similar to align-items, but instead of aligning flex items, it aligns flex lines
	
flex-flow:
	A shorthand propert for flex-direction and flex-wrap
	
	
	
Here is the list of properties for flexbox items.

order:
	Specifies the order of a flexible item relative to the rest of the flex items inside the same container

align-self:
	Used on flex items. Overrides the container's align-items property

flex:
	Specifies the length of a flex item, relative to the rest of the flex items inside the same container
