Problem : Celebrity Problem 
-----------------
A celebrity among a group of n people is a person who knows
nobody but is known by everybody else. The task is to identify a celebrity by only
asking questions to people of the following form: “Do you know this person?”

Approach
========
Let's assume there are n people in the group. 

For simplicity we will start with n=1. This means the person is celebrity.
If n=2 we have two persons A and B. Let's ask the question to A. If A saya he knows B, then A is not celebrity so remove A from group. This will reduce the group to n-1 people. If A saya he does not know B then B is not celebrity so B can be removed from the group. This will reduce the group to n-1 people. This way the problem size will kept reducing by iteration.


Problem : Number Guessing 
=========================
 Determine a selected integer in the range from
1 to n, inclusive, by asking questions with yes/no answers.

Approach
========
First queston if guessed number is greater than n/2 will reduce the problem space to half.
